<h1>Who am I anyway?</h1>
<p><div class="bio">
Hello, my name is Eric David Mariasis and I am a junior who is majoring in Computer Science<br/>
and Engineering at Tufts University. I have been passionate about my enthusiasm for principles<br/>
of math and logic ever since I could remember. Stunning people in class with shortcuts to formulae<br/> 
introduced to us was always amusing. As for programming, it was originally just a skill I wanted to <br/> 
"try out" in college because it seemed to be a practical application of math and logic. Never did I</br>
expect that I would go so far with it, and stick through some of the most challenging programming</br>
classes in the United States. That being said, here I am ready as ever to learn more programming skills</br>
and languages that will help solve future problems and make a difference in the world.</div></p>
